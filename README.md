# AI Customer Support Bot - Project Documentation

## Objective

Create an AI-driven customer support bot capable of simulating realistic customer interactions by handling FAQs and escalation cases with deep LLM integration, contextual memory, and session management. The system automates customer query responses while enabling seamless escalation to human agents when necessary.

---

## Scope of Work

- **Input:**  
  - Company FAQ dataset for direct question-answering.  
  - Customer queries arriving via REST API calls.

- **Contextual Memory:**  
  - Maintains multi-turn conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses.

- **Escalation Handling:**  
  - Automatic escalation for unanswered or complex queries with simulated notification to human support.

- **Frontend Chat Interface:**  
  - An integrated user-friendly chat UI allowing real-time interaction with AI and humans.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend API

- Implements REST endpoints using FastAPI providing query processing, session creation and management, conversation summarization, and next action retrieval.
- Maintains persistent session and conversation data using a database backend.

### LLM Integration

- Google's Gemini 2.5-flash model powers AI-generated conversational responses.
- Advanced prompt engineering injects structured conversation and concise company data.
- Implements multi-step processing including retries with exponential backoff.

### FAQ Handling

- Loads and indexes company FAQs with exact and fuzzy matching.
- Provides immediate, precise answers from the FAQ dataset where possible.
- Fallback to LLM-generated answer on no FAQ match, ensuring full coverage.

### Contextual Memory & Company Data

- Injects historical conversation and relevant company policy snippets dynamically into prompts to ground LLM-generated responses.

### Escalation System

- Detects fallback, ambiguous, or explicit escalation requests via regex patterns.
- Generates escalation notes and asynchronously notifies human support teams.
- Provides clear user communication around escalation status.

### Next Actions Suggestion

- Extracts AI-recommended user next steps after the main response.
- Enhances user guidance and interaction effectiveness.

### Frontend Chat Interface

- Real-time chat UI integrated with backend API for seamless end-user interaction.
- Supports multi-turn dialog handling and session management.
- Shows AI responses, suggestion buttons, and escalation notifications intuitively.

### Enhanced Intent Recognition

- Implements keyword and pattern based detection for user intents including escalation inquiries.
- Allows refined routing of queries and user requests for better AI-human handoff.

### Multi-Lingual Support

- Supports customer interactions in multiple languages (configurable).
- Allows broader accessibility and market reach.

### Ticketing System Integration

- Connects escalations with human support ticketing workflows.
- Automates ticket creation, status tracking, and agent assignment.

## Setup and Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-customer-support-chatbot.git
cd ai-customer-support-chatbot


2. Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set environment variables:
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"


4. Ensure the `data/faqs.json` file is properly populated with your company-specific FAQs and policies.

5. Launch the backend API service:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


6. Launch frontend interface server (if applicable), or integrate with your existing frontend.

---

## Usage Instructions

- Submit customer queries to `/api/query` endpoint, optionally including `session_id` for conversation context.
- Use session endpoints to retrieve conversation history summaries and suggestions via REST.
- Monitor escalations in logs or via your integrated support ticketing system.
- Utilize the chat interface for real-time interactions providing conversational context and escalation flow.

---

## Functional Workflow

1. Incoming queries are first matched against the FAQ dataset for exact or fuzzy hits.
2. If no FAQ answer found, prompt is constructed with conversation history and company data.
3. Google Gemini generates the AI response.
4. Response text undergoes analysis to detect fallback or escalation triggers.
5. Escalations trigger user notification and human support ticket creation asynchronously.
6. AI-provided next actions guide the user proactively.
7. Multi-turn conversations maintain context over sessions.
8. Frontend chat displays AI responses, suggestions, and escalation status clearly with seamless human transfer.
